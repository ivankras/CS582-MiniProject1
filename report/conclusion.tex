After evaluating nine classifier models, including two ensembles and a model given by AutoML,
we find as our best option for predicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction the Voting Classifier,
with five different classifiers as inputs (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, MLP and Stochastic Gradient Descent),
each one of them with their tuned parameters.\\
Although this is an extensive study, possibilities are much more and (most likely) outperforming our choice.
Also, batch-processing done during this research is not as demanding as more complex Machine Learning technologies
(deeper Neural Networks, more complex ensembles, etc.). There's still much work to do.
