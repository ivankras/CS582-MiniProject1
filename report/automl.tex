\subsection{Presentation}
AutoML is a tool for choosing the best model (or ensemble) for fitting and predicting a dataset.\\
If using scikit-learn, the proper toolkit is defined as \href{https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/}{auto-sklearn}.

\subsection{Obtaining the Model}
Simply fitting the training data to the AutoSklearnClassifier gives us an "optimal" model.\\
In this case (shown by \emph{running model.show\_models}()), the result is an ensemble of several ensembles, involving SVMs, Random Forests, etc.

\subsection{AUC vs best model}
We calculated the AUC curve from plotting the AutoSKlearnClassifier vs our best model, the Voting Classifier,
