        Machine Learning models are used to predict data of interest using known data as input.
        For an airline, it is useful to be able to predict if a passenger will be satisfied with their flight, and what to improve in case for those passengers who won't.
        Classifiers are the Machine Learning resource for said predictions.\\
        The goal of this study is to test several classifiers for predicting Airline Passengers Satisfaction, show their performance and optimize them, in order to choose the best of them.
